Program a model of a vending machine.  It should at least satisfy the following requirements:
* Contains various products, each of which can be retrieved by entering in the correct amount of money, and then punching in the code for that item
* Dispenses change after making a purchase
* Has a cancel button that returns the user’s change
* Ability to stock/restock items in the machine
* Any other functionality that you think a vending machine should have!
It's not required that you build any sort of user interface, but there should be some demonstration of the model’s functionality.
